    <h2>Bello / Medium</h2>
    <p>Founded in 1999 by Akiem Helmling, Sami Kortemaki, and Bas Jacobs, is the typeface: Bello (<a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/bello">Bello</a>). Bello is another one of Underware’s typefaces, which is a famous font foundry. This specific typeface includes two main types that have a strong contrast: script and caps (<a href="https://www.linotype.com/5783/bello.html">Monotype</a>). Being the typographic mate of Sauna, Bello is used to create a natural impression with a lot of starting and ending swashes. Bello has been used in many cases, such as provoking holiday cards, addressing critical issues, branding, graffiti, advertisements, or even Francois Hollande’s 2012 Presidential Campaign in France(<a href="https://fontsinuse.com/search?terms=bello">Search Results).</a></p>
